              <h2 id="h2" >Choosing a type of security guard</h2>
							<p itemprop="description" >There are many factors to consider when
							 choosing an armed or unarmed security officer to protect your
							 business. What kind of threat are you trying to deter? Has there
							been an incident or are you trying to prevent an incident?
              Take the time to carefully consider what kind of guard you need for your
							 situation. If you are trying to protect your merchandise from theft, then
							 then an unarmed officer would be a good choice. If your business has been robbed
							or someone is threatening your business, employees or customers then an armed guard
              might be needed for a higher level of protection. If you aren't sure what kind of guard
              if right for you situation, give us a call and we would be happy to help provide
              assistance with making this important choice.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              When deciding on a company to hire, make sure to verify that the company is fully licensed
              and insured to work in your area of operation. Do a Google search for the company
              and look for reviews of their armed and unarmed officers. Also look for reviews about
              the company itself to make sure they have a solid track record of providing
              high quality security guards both armed and unarmed.
