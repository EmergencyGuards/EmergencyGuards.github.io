							<p itemprop="description" >Security guard training is an integral part of 
								any professional security guard companies success. Depending on the requirements
								of each state guards can be trained in any or all of the following: Arrest and detention, 
								Weapons of Mass Destruction, Public Relations, Observation and Documentation, Communication,
								Liability and Legal, Firearms Certification, Security Guard Conduct, Incident Reporting.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								<h3>Arrest and Detention</h3>
								  Preparing guards to deal with detaining and possibly arresting perpetators while observing
								  the law is an important aspect of any guards trainig. The stress of dealing with an incident
								  while it's in progress can make it difficult for guards to make the correct decisions. Thorough
								  training will ensure that the guards are prepared. 
								    <br/>
								    <br/>
								 <h3>Weapons of Mass Destruction</h3>
									  Guards need to be trained to detect possible terrorst threats no matter where they're posted. 
									  Learning to notice the indicators of a possible attack and how to quickly and effectively 
									  respond is the basis of weapons of mass destruction training. 
									  <br/>
									  <br/>
									<h3>Incident Reporting</h3>
										When an incidnet occurs, officers need to be able to clearly communicate
										the events that occured to law enforcement, the client and their own company.
										Preparing guards to deal with detaining and possibly arresting perpetators while observing
								    the law is an important aspect of any guards trainig. 
									  <br/>
									  <br/>
									<h3>Observation and Documentation</h3>
							      Sometimes guards need to observe and report instead of intervening. In this case it's 
							      important that the guard is trained to accurately document the events as they are 
							      taking place and to also notify the autorities right away with accurate details so the 
							      local police department can respond to the situation.
